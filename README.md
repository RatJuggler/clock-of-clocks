# clock-of-clocks
It's a clock, but sort of made up of clocks. You can see it running [here](https://ratjuggler.github.io/clock-of-clocks/src/index.html).

I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) which is great for playing round with graphics on HTML canvas.

I've got a mechanism for moving the clock hands randomly, displaying the time and showing predefined patterns, but transitioning 
between the different effects feels a bit clunky.

Some hand positions used to create the digit outlines and patterns would not be possible on a normal clock, so it might be 
interesting at some point to produce another version which only uses real clock positions.
