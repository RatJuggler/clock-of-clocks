# clock-of-clocks
It's a clock, but sort of made up of clocks. You can see it running [here](https://ratjuggler.github.io/clock-of-clocks/src/index.html).

I've got a mechanism for moving the clocks randomly, displaying the time and showing predefined patterns, but transitioning between 
the different feels a bit clunky.
